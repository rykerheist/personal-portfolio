                            <p>Hi, I'm John Willsdon. I'm not your average instructional designer.</p>

                            <p>While other instructional designers were busy color-coding their sticky notes and alphabetizing their font collections, I was figuring out how to hack the human brain and make learning stick. I've spent years honing my craft, experimenting with unconventional techniques, and pushing the boundaries of what's possible in the world of learning.</p>

                            <p>Our methods might be a little... unorthodox. Okay, maybe some people have called them "insane," "reckless," or even "borderline illegal." But hey, all I care about is results. And my results are so damn good, they'll make you question everything you thought you knew about training.</p>

                                <li><strong>Addicted to Effectiveness:</strong> I don't do "fluffy" or "just for show." If it doesn't work, it's getting tossed out the window.</li>
                                <li><strong>Allergic to Boredom:</strong> If I catch even a whiff of dull, yawn-inducing content, I break out in hives. My learning experiences are designed to be engaging, entertaining, and maybe even a little bit addictive.</li>
                                <li><strong>Love/Hate Relationship with the Status Quo:</strong> I love to challenge it. I hate that it exists. Let's just say, I'm not here to maintain the peace. I'm here to start a learning revolution.</li>
                                <li><strong>I believe that anything is possible:</strong> And that anyone can learn anything with the right material.</li>

We'll dig deep into the guts of your organisation, figure out what makes your learners tick (or not tick), and identify the root of your training problems.  No stone unturned, no sacred cow un-tipped. We'll figure out what your learners need, even if they don't know themselves.</p>

This is where we take all that juicy data we unearthed and turn it into a blueprint for a learning experience so potent it should come with a warning label. We're talking mind-bending scenarios, gamification that's actually addictive, and content so engaging it'll make your learners forget they're supposed to be learning. We'll make it so good they'll be begging to be trained.</p>

We'll meticulously measure the impact of your training, scrutinize the data like a hawk, and figure out what worked, what didn't, and what we can make even more mind-blowingly awesome next time. We'll see what got them hooked and what we can do to make them never want to leave. The goal is to do better than perfect, we want to blow their expectations out of the water.</p>
